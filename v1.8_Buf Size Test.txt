[ Elapsed time test by Buf size ]

4 files, 2.16GB

Show = Show ProgressBar & Percent on MainForm
Hide = Skip ProgressBar & Percent on MainForm
Note : Tested as 32bit (a little faster at 64bit)


v1.7

Buf	Show	Hide
0.5MB	19s	7s
1MB	13s	7s
2MB	11s	7s => pick 11s
3MB	10s	7s
4MB	10s	7s
8MB	9s	7s


v1.8

Buf	Show	Hide
0.5MB	9s	7s
1MB	8s	7s
2MB	8s	7s => pick 8s
3MB	8s	7s
4MB	8s	7s
8MB	8s	7s


Test result :
Showing ProgressBar & Percent take quite a lot of time
The best choice seems to be 2MB
On thread it got faster (11s => 8s)
